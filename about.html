    <p class = "aboutText"> Future Coders Foundation was founded in 2024 by two university students studying computer science. We noticed that CS programs were getting more selective and the 
      job market was getting more competitive. Students who had access to programming resources early on are more likely to be successful in the field.  While trying to find ways to support students in under-served communities
      we noticed that many students didn't have access to basic technology required for computer programming. Our goal is to repurpose old laptops and donate them to students in need with the help of
      local non-profits and schools.

    <p class = "about-overlay2"> My name is Sinclair Hansen and I am a computer science student studying at Schoolcraft College.
    As a CS student, I've noticed the importance of having coding resources early on in education. The field can be quite
    competitive, and having community support can help students improve their skills exponentially. That's my goal for 
    Future Coders Foundation, and I look forward to sharing a skill that I find very enjoyable with my community.

    <p class = "about-overlay3">  My name is Alex and I'm a Computer Science student at The University of Michigan. I'm starting Future Coders
      Foundation because I am passionate about growing the coding community and giving back to students in need.     I look forward to seeing its growth
      and impact on education in Southeast Michigan.
