    <h3>Kid's Intro to Coding</h3>
    <a class="resourceTitle" href="https://www.scratchjr.org/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScratchJr</a>
    <p class="resourceDescription">"ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that 
      enables young children (ages 5-7) to create their own interactive stories and games. 
      Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, 
      jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own 
      voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life."</p>
    
    
      <a class="resourceTitle" href="https://www.codemonkey.com/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Monkey</a>
    <p class="resourceDescription">"CodeMonkey is an AWARD-WINNING online platform that teaches kids real coding 
      languages like CoffeeScript and Python. Children and teenagers learn block-based and 
      text-based coding through an engaging game-like environment."</p>
